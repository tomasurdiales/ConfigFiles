# Tom√°s Urdiales

Config files for a quick setup of the shell environment on a new MacOS/Linux machine.
Also contains: scripts to make some workflows quicker when added to system path, karabiner.json profile, bookmark backups, Brewfile, Raycast config, Starship config for iTerm, etc.

Files in the Executables folder are to be symlinked to usr/local/bin.
Dotfiles in the general repository are to be symlinked to home directory.
Setup.sh automates this process (replace or remove the .gitconfig file in this repository and check .zshrc).
